ANTP-Google-Bookmarks
=====================

Awesome New Tab Page extension for read-only access to Google Bookmarks

Originally based on the RSS feed reader by Daniel Petisme, but it's moved along a great deal since then.

Supports anything from 1x1 up. Multicolumns as you increase the width. Scrolls appear if you don't have the 
vertical space for you whole list.
